# Arc CPS

Demo of a functional implementation of <code>dynamic-wind</code>, in a
language which has primitive continuations and parameters.

Runs &nbsp;e x t r e m e l y &nbsp; s l o w l y&nbsp; due to multiple
layers of unoptimized code.  This is a proof of concept of a thought
experiment...  not a useful implementation to program in.
